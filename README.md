<!--  -->
I am a web development student currently halfway through my vocational studies in web development. I am expanding my knowledge in both front-end and back-end development, with a focus on Angular and PHP. I love to learn and build something new, productive, innovative, and creative.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

Angular
PHP
Exploring Nest.js as part of my back-end development learning path.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborating on open-source projects.

âœ” Ask me about anything related to web development, PHP, or Angular, I am happy to help.

Outside of tech, ðŸ’œ I enjoy playing video games, ðŸŽ® especially MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, and ðŸŽµ listening to music.
